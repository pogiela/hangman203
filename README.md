# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. The Game asks the user for a letter and checks if it is in the word. It starts with a default number of lives and a random word from the word_list.
